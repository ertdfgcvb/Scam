Anaglyph (etymology)
--------------------

From Ancient Greek ἀναγλυφή (anagluphḗ, “work in low relief”); from ana (up) + glyphein (to carve out)

Noun
Anaglyph (plural anaglyphs)

1. A decorative ornament worked in low relief or bas relief, such as a piece of cameo jewelry.

2. A matched pair of images designed to produce a three-dimensional effect when viewed using spectacles that have usually one red and one bluish-green lens, corresponding to the colors of the pairs of images.
